# Image-Resizer-Through-Seam_Carving
##Dependencies:
You’ll need to install the python image library Pillow to extract RGB
values of each pixel and to generate images back from RGB values of
each pixel.
To install Pillow: pip install Pillow
The python script is only compatible with Linux/Mac operating systems.
If there are enough Windows users, we might release the script for
Windows too.
If you’re a windows user you can request us for the input text
file(rgb_in.txt) so that you can start working on the problem.
##How to Run:
Open the Q3 directory in the terminal and run the python file driver.py
located in /src. Also, you need to pass the input image filename(must be
present inside /data/input) as a command line argument.
Ex: python ./src/driver.py sample1.jpeg
